    case wing = "Airplane wings create lift to enable flight through their aerodynamic shape, which creates a difference in pressure above and below the wing. Air moves faster above, creating lower pressure, and slower below, creating higher pressure, resulting in a lifting force."
    
    case lateral = "The aerodynamic profile of an airplane wing and fuselage is designed to minimize drag and maximize lift. The wing's curved upper surface and flat lower surface create a difference in air pressure that generates lift, allowing the plane to fly. The fuselage's streamlined shape minimizes air resistance, helping to reduce drag and increase the plane's speed."
    
    case rudder = "The rudder is a control surface on the vertical tail fin of an airplane that controls the aircraft's yaw, or movement about the vertical axis. The rudder deflects the airflow, creating a force that turns the aircraft in the desired direction, the rudder is essential for controlling the plane's direction during takeoff, landing, and flight."
    
    case elevator = "The elevator is a control surface on the horizontal tail of an airplane that controls the aircraft's pitch, or movement about the lateral axis. The elevator works by deflecting the airflow over the horizontal tail, creating a force that causes the plane to pitch up or down. The elevator is essential for controlling the plane's altitude and for making smooth changes in pitch during takeoff, landing, and flight."
    
    case aboutMe = "Thank you for getting here, all my life I have been passionate about aviation and everything that flies, along my journey I always try to take a bit of my passion in the form of knowledge to other people, teaching about planes, drones and everything that can reach the Skies, one day I will be an airplane pilot, then I will be fully realized, until that day I will always tell my story and passion for aviation"
